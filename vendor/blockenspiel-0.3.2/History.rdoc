=== 0.3.2 / 2009-11-17

* Modules included in a DSL-ized class now have their methods included in
  the DSL.
* Raise a more informative error (for now) when trying to include
  Blockenspiel::DSL in a module. At some point, we'll support this usage,
  once I figure out the right semantics for it.

=== 0.3.1 / 2009-11-08

* Blockenspiel#invoke can now take its options hash as the second argument
  (instead of the third) when using dynamic target generation, since the
  second argument is otherwise unused in this case.
* Now defines Blockenspiel::VERSION, as a versionomy object if the
  versionomy library is available, or as a version string if not.

=== 0.3.0 / 2009-11-04

* dsl_attr_writer and dsl_attr_accessor convenience methods are available
  for creating DSL-friendly attributes.
* Dynamic DSL methods can now take real block arguments, if supported by
  the Ruby interpreter.
* Shortened README.rdoc and renamed the longer version to Blockenspiel.rdoc.
* Some documentation updates.

=== 0.2.2 / 2009-10-28

* Support for gemcutter hosting in the build/release scripts.
* Some clarifications to constant scopes internal in the code.
* A few documentation updates.
* Minor changes to the Implementing DSL Blocks paper to deal with
  Why's disappearance.

=== 0.0.3 / 2008-10-23
